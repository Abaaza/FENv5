# The Fencing People - Deployment Status

## ‚úÖ What's Working
1. **Backend is running** on EC2 (44.223.70.138) port 5000
2. **Health endpoint works**: http://44.223.70.138:5000/api/health
3. **Admin user exists**: abaza@tfp.com (confirmed by "User already exists" error)
4. **Convex is deployed**: https://bright-scorpion-424.convex.cloud

## ‚ùå Current Issues
1. **Login returns "Internal server error"** - likely a Convex connection issue from backend
2. **HTTPS not configured** - Nginx needs manual setup
3. **Mixed content error** - Amplify (HTTPS) trying to call backend (HTTP)

## üîß Quick Solutions

### Option 1: Use HTTP for Testing (Fastest)
1. Open Chrome/Edge with disabled security:
   ```
   chrome.exe --disable-web-security --user-data-dir="C:/temp"
   ```
2. Access your app and it will work with HTTP

### Option 2: Deploy Backend to Lambda (Recommended)
Since you already have Lambda deployment scripts, use the original serverless deployment which automatically provides HTTPS.

### Option 3: Fix Nginx Manually
SSH into the server and create the config manually:
```bash
ssh -i "C:\Users\abaza\Downloads\tfp-boq-key.pem" ec2-user@44.223.70.138
sudo nano /etc/nginx/conf.d/api.conf
```

Paste this simple config:
```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name _;
    
    ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/cert.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/key.pem;
    
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:5000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }
}
```

Then:
```bash
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

## üìù Login Issue Fix
The "Internal server error" during login suggests the backend can't connect to Convex properly. This could be due to:

1. **Missing environment variables** in the .env file
2. **Convex schema not matching** what the backend expects
3. **Network issues** from EC2 to Convex

### To debug further:
1. Check if all required Convex functions are deployed:
   ```bash
   cd C:\Users\abaza\OneDrive\Desktop\FENv5
   npx convex deploy
   ```

2. Ensure the backend has all required environment variables

## üöÄ Recommended Next Steps
1. **For immediate testing**: Use Chrome with disabled security
2. **For production**: Either fix Nginx or use Lambda deployment
3. **Update Amplify** once HTTPS is working:
   - VITE_API_URL = https://44.223.70.138/api
   - Redeploy Amplify
